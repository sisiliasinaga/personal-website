The Interface Usage Skills Test is a clinician-facing, open-source application to track mobility progress of stroke and spinal cord injury patients undergoing physical rehabilitation. The test consists of two tasks, command following and trajectory following, and the app calculates relevant features regarding the user’s ability to follow both tasks with a given interface controller.

<br />
These features are then stored to the user’s profile, allowing clinicians to track a patient’s progress over time. 
<br />
Under the guidance of Prof. Brenna Argall at Northwestern University, I designed and built the full application using the Godot game engine to design the game/app mechanics, GDScript to build the frontend and app logic, and SQLite to store user data in the backend. The project showed me how important it is to account for human preferences and behaviors throughout the system design and engineering process. I was also co-author for a conference paper on the Interface Usage Skills Test published at the International Conference on Rehabilitative Robotics.
