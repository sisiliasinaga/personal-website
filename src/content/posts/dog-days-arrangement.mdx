In June, my previous dance team New Age Theatrics put on a show together with the nonprofit Healing Heels to help promote mental health awareness. The show followed a main character that was overcome with depression, having to face literal demons and darkness, but she eventually finds the light and the “good” that brings her out of that depression. The story is mainly told through acting and choreography, but as I had grown up training in classical violin and still maintained my violin playing, my director wanted to incorporate me playing my violin into the show. We went back and forth on what parts of the show made the most sense to incorporate it, but we eventually decided on two parts.
