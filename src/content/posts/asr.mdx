The ASR is an audiohaptic, Bluetooth-enabled shoulder rest built and designed by Prof. Seth Thorn of Arizona State University to support violinists and violists during practice. The device pairs with a corresponding mobile app that allows players to adjust both audio and haptic feedback, helping them internalize the rhythm and tempo more easily. The ASR also streams backing tracks directly through the device for players who want steady rhythms to play or freestyle over.

I assisted in beta-testing an earlier version of the ASR and implemented several improvements, including updated Bluetooth communication, low-battery functionality, and bug fixes. This work introduced me to wearable music and the process of translating musical expressivity into computational form within an academic setting. This also showed me how computational feedback can support musical performance and practice, a theme that carries into my desired research interests.
